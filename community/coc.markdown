Code of Conduct
===============

We all come together for a common goal of improving the Project and its Community. There is more to a project and its community than simple completion of assigned tasks, interacting with other members is often just as - or more - important. 

Community Spaces
----------------

Community Spaces include wikis, mailing lists, IRC channels, version control, conferences, meet ups, websites, and any other form of communication, gathering, or media hosted, endorsed, or sponsored by the Project or Community.

Prohibitions
------------

There are incalculable combinations of race, belief system, culture, age, gender identity and expression, sexual preference and orientation, physical and mental ability, appearance, neuro(a)typicality, economic status, caste, class, political affiliation, language familiarity, nation of origin or residence, and many other variables which should not be used to unfairly judge a person's worth or contributions.

Threatening, abusing, harassing, discriminating against, spoofing, doxing, outing, censoring, stalking, or impersonating another member is strictly forbidden.

Sockpuppeting, astroturfing, trolling, and flamebaiting the community is strictly forbidden.

Hate speech, use of prejudicial epithets, calls to violence, abuse of power, encouragement of harm to others or self-harm, are all strictly forbidden. 

If you witness any of the above in a Community Space, please contact the Community Standards Team immediately.

It is a part of every memberâ€™s role to maintain self-awareness of their own behavior and unless you are on the Community Standards Team, It is not your responsibility to police the words and actions of anyone else in the community.
