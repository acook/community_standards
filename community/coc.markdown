Code of Conduct
===============

We all come together for a common goal of improving the Project and its Community. There is more to a project and its community than simple completion of assigned tasks, interacting with other members is often just as - or more - important.

There are incalculable combinations of race, belief system, culture, age, gender identity and expression, sexual preference and orientation, physical and mental ability, appearance, neuro(a)typicality, economic status, caste, class, political affiliation, language familiarity, nation of origin or residence, and many other variables which should not be used to unfairly judge a person's worth or contributions.

Encouraged Behaviour
--------------------

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Prohibited Behaviour
--------------------

* Any kind of online/offline sexual/physical/verbal/emotional threats, abuse, harassment, intimidation, discrimination, insults, spoofing, doxing, outing, censoring, stalking, or impersonating another member is strictly forbidden.
* Sockpuppeting, astroturfing, trolling, and flamebaiting the community is strictly forbidden.
* Hate speech, use of prejudicial epithets, calls to violence, abuse of power or status, encouragement of harm to others or self-harm, are all strictly forbidden. 

If your ideology (such as political affiliation) or demonstrated behaviour conflicts with these guidelines you may be excluded from Community Spaces.

If you witness any of the above in a Community Space, please contact the Community Standards Team immediately.

Community Spaces
----------------

Community Spaces include wikis, mailing lists, IRC channels, version control, conferences, meet ups, websites, and any other form of communication, gathering, or media hosted, endorsed, or sponsored by the Project or Community.

Use of this Document
--------------------

Individuals who violate these guidelines will be excluded from Community Spaces. A discussion preceeding this act may be warranted, but is not required and will be handled on a case-by-case basis.

It is an important part of every member's role to maintain self-awareness of their own behavior and unless you are on the Community Standards Team, it is not your responsibility to police the words and actions of anyone else in the community. 

Reporting violations of these guidelines will not be retaliated against and will be kept anonymous unless the reporter requests otherwise. However, misuse of these guidelines to bully members is not within the spirit of the community and will be trated as harassment and dealt with accordingly.

Questions and comments about this document should take place in the [Project Standards repository](https://github.com/acook/project_standards/) and not on individual project pages.
