Code of Conduct
===============

There is more to a project and its community than simple completion of assigned tasks, interacting with other members is often just as - or more - important.

Community Spaces
----------------

Community Spaces include wikis, mailing lists, IRC channels, version control, conferences, meet ups, websites, and any other form of communication, gathering, or media hosted or sponsored by the Project or using the Project’s name.

Membership
----------

We all come together for a common goal of improving the Project and its Community.

We embrace a community of people from all over the world, with different customs, languages, and belief systems. There are incalculable combinations of race, religion, age, gender identity and expression, sexual preference and orientation, physical and mental ability, appearance, neuro(a)typicality, economic status, caste, class, political affiliation, language familiarity, nation of origin or residence, and many other variables which make up the composition of this community.

Discrimination and prejudice has no place in our community.

Prohibitions
------------

Threatening, abusing, harassing, discriminating against, spoofing, doxing, outing, censoring, or impersonating another member is strictly forbidden.

Sockpuppeting, astroturfing, trolling, and flamebaiting the community is strictly forbidden.

Hate speech, use of prejudicial epithets, calls to violence, encouragement of harm to others or self-harm, are all strictly forbidden.

If you witness any of the above, please contact the Community Standards Team immediately.

Remedies
--------

The Community Standards Team or the moderators of the given Community Space may take any action they deem appropriate.

- Official Private or Public Warning

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse.
